            Hello! My name is Akinyemi Borisade but, I go by Yemi to make it easier. I was born in Jacksonville, FL
            and
            happen to be the youngest of my 3 siblings. I would eventually graduate high school and attend the
            University of
            North Florida to obtain my Bachelor's in Criminal Justice. While obtaining my bachelor's degree, I met my
            compass, soon to be wife. Soon after that I obtained my Master's in
            Criminal
            Justice and became a police officer.

        </p>
        <p>
            My wife and I went on to create a family that now consist of two rambunctious boys. The oldest is 6years old
            and is already promising to become a dentist while my youngest son is 2 years old and living a car free
            life.
        </p>
        <p>

            What started as a dream job of policing turned into a dream differed as it became a career that was no
            longer for
            me.
            This
            brought me to the wonderful and limitless world of software development and engineering. I believe this
            is a
            field where I can truly show and devlop my talents further while aiding company practices.
